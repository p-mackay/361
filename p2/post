Can the data file be broken up in to 1024 byte chunks in the application layer enqueuedÂ then passed to the sender?

is this design fine? 

Wait for SYN ACK.
application layer: 
    immediately split the file into 1024 byte pieces, enque each peice.
    sender makes a call in main to receive data (get_nowait)
sender:
    enque each 1024 peice 
    packetize 
    enque each packet
    start sending MSS packets to receiver. 

OR: 

application layer:
    data is continuously sent in a data stream. (the max send amount) by calls from sender.
sender:
    the sender stores the continuous data stream.
    then packet size (payload size) is determined on the fly as the sender receives ACKs. 
    should the sender wait until the rcv window can store the maximum segment size? Or send 
    as much data (up to a threshold) as it can.
